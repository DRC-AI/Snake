''' Hello, welcome to the Snake game by Oskar Lundmark!
    I wrote this game as a learning experience,
    i know there are much to be improved but it
    all works and has all the funtionality
    i set out to create. 

    Maybe in the future i will come back and impove
    the readability and funtionality,
    but really now i just want to hop on
    the next learning experience.
    Thank you for playing my first ever game!'''

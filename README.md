# Snake
A Snake game for the Terminal written in Python.

To run the game make sure you have Curses installed and then run the package.

This game is still very much under construction. As of not there is no way of
exiting the game exept using ctrl + c and the snake can still pass trough itself without consequenses.. 

Missing features are:

 * Locally stored leaderboard system.

 * Functioning menu.

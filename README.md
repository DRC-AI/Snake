# Snake
A simple Snake game for the Terminal written in Python.

To run the game make sure you have Curses installed and then run using: python3 /path/to/directory.

This game is still very much under construction. There is a ton of QOL changes to be made and some features to be added. 

I wrote this game first and foremost as a learning experience. My goal is to learn not just to write code that works, but to write code that is easy to understand, easy to maintain, update and that also comforms to the correct way of doing things. If you have any feedback on the project or just want to let me know what you think of the game you can reach me on: oskar.lundmark@proton.me.

Thanks for reading!
